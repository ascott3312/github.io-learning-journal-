# Computer Architecture and Logic
 1. Input 
 2. Storage
 3. Processing
 4. Output

 ## Memory
 - Storage and processing gets input and uses a computers memeory to store and process the inuput to be sent to the output.
 - Memory and a CPU (Central Processing Unit) calcuates information
 - Input flows into memory and the CPU and then is passed to the output

### Computers
 - Works with 0 and 1 and is a big part of how computers work in the inside of a computer.
 - Wires and circuits carry all information in a computer.
 - Birnary number system **O** and **1** 
 - Number of wires defines the number of 0 and 1 that can be stored.
 - Text, Images, and Sound can be represented by a 0 and 1

#### Circuits
 - Electric signal can be either on or off or *0* or *1*
 - Two bits together is called an adders (mutiple adders can be side by side to cacluate bigger numbers)
 - Electricity moves at the speed of light - so a circuit can perform billions of calcuation a second with today's circuits

##### Hardware and Software
 - Hardware conations ciruits, chips, speakers, plugs, and wires 
 - Software is code that can be an app, games, websites, maps, and analysis
 - CPU intergrates the Hardware and Software inside a computer with a Operation System as the master program
