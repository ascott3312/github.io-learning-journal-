# Creating a JavaScript - Step One
 1. Sketching out the tasks in a flowchart will equate to individual lines of code
 1. Each step in the flowchart needs to be written in a language the computer can understand
 1. Learn how think like a computer
 1. Define a goal and then design the script from the tasks in the flowchart to get to the goal.

## Step Two - Computers create models of the world using data
- Objects can have their own 
   - Properities (has a name and a value)
   - Events (how humans interact with the object) - also determine which events the programmer must deal with.
   - Methods (what we do with the objects)
- Putting it all together (Web Browsers are programs built using objects)

### Objects
- Document represents an HTML Page

#### JavaScripts using the following
- Expressions - define a signle variable or multiple varaiable in JavaSript.
- Operators are used to determine either a single value or multiple values
- Aritmetic operators- perform math based on the variables and operators used. 
  - Additon = +
  - Subraction = -
  - Division = /
  - Multipaction = *
  - Increment = ++
  - Decrement = ==
  - Modulus = % - (Remainder in doing division)
- String operators - a way to bring to string elements to together or to be dislayed on screen
   - A N&N value is when using any of the aritmetic operators with a string- If you add a number with a string then the number becomes part of the string.
###### Functions
1. Let you grouo series of statements together to performa specific task.
1. Use a descriptive name to define the function
1. Parameters pass pieces of information to a function
1. Declaring - statements to complete the task inside the curly brackets
