# Git Overview
  - Git is a vesrsion control tool that trackes the changes that you make in creating a web page.
  - The different versions are stored a snap shot in which you can view the code that was added from the last commit.
  If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

 1. git commit - records what you did in the commit performed
 1. git add * - Adds the changes to your project
 1. git push origin master - Pushes changes from your desktop
