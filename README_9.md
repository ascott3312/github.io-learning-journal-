### Loops
- Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run again and will continue to run until the condition returns a false.
    - FOR - most common loop and usually used as a counter (specific number of times to run)
        - Initialization - thru a variable
        - Condition - counter reaches a specific number
        - Update - Every time the loop has performed the statemnts inside the curly brackets , it adds one to the counter
    - WHILE - used when you don't know the speicif number of times to run 
    - DO WHILE - will run at least once (inside the curly brackets) even it it returns False
